# Anthony Leaman - Professional Resume Website
A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing professional experience, education, and career goals in data analytics.

## 🌐 Live Website

**Current Site:** [https://yaboyshades.github.io/resume-](https://yaboyshades.github.io/resume-)

### 🚀 Root Domain Setup
To access the site at `https://yaboyshades.github.io` (without `/resume-`), you'll need to:

1. Create a new repository named `yaboyshades.github.io`
2. Use the provided `redirect-index.html` as the `index.html` in that repository
3. Run `./setup-root-domain.sh` for detailed instructions

This will allow both URLs to work:
- `https://yaboyshades.github.io` → redirects to resume site
- `https://yaboyshades.github.io/resume-` → main resume site
